# Static Website

- Deployed using Terraform
- Hosted on AWS S3 with CloudFront
- Potential for further Automation actions to be added with GitHub Workflows

# REQUIREMENTS - Working with this repo

In order to use the code here you will need the following

- Terraform Installed - https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli
- AWS CLI Installed - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html
- AWS Credentials correctly configured on your machine using your preferred method e.g. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds

# Deploy

Once you have the requirements and you have cloned this repository and made any changes to the app/webpage, you can run both

```
terraform init
```

and 

```
terraform plan
```

to initialise terraform and creat a terraform plan.

Note that in providers tf, the backend for the terraform state file is in s3, specifically the bucket <<ORG>-<APPLICATION>-backend-statefile-<REGION>>
this bucket has been created manually in AWS for now, there is the potential to create this bucket and its policy via a script (not terraform) in the future/for future deployments.

If a plan has successfully been made you can then run 

```
terraform apply
```

to deploy the website.

# Code

This code contains the following components

- s3 bucket that hosts the website files (found in /dist/) for our www subdomain, this can be found in s3.tf

- an s3 bucket which serves as a redirect to our www subdomain. i.e. if someone were to visit testdomain.com they would be redirested to www.subdomain.com. This can also be found in s3.tf

- A validated SSL wildcard certificate for our domain which automatically renews. This can be found in acm.tf. Currently we have the initial validation of the domian set to DNS, however the potential to validate the domain via email is also an option

- Cloudfront distribution for the www and base domain which serves as our CDN - Cloudfront allows us to cache our page to allow for faster loading times and larger scale. See cloudfront.tf

- Route53 records pointing to our Cloudfront distributions. in route53.tf

#Invalidating the cache 

At the moment we have a Github workflow set up to automate the invalidation of the cloudfront cache. It can be found in .github/workflows/invalidate-cache.yml
THIS WILL ONLY RUN IF YOU HAVE PUSHED THE REPO TO GITHUB OR MANUALLY TRIGGERED THE WORKFLOW

i.e. if you were to make a change to the webpage and run terraform apply from your local machine - the cache will not invalidate/clear and will still display the old webpage.

You can push the changes to github to invalidate the cache/or run the cache clear manually from github workflows.

OR you can run the below command from the CLI to invalidate the cache (You must be authenticated on the AWS command lime for this to work) 

```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <DISTRIBUTION> --paths "/*"
```

Where <DISTRIBUTION> is the Cloudfront ID associated with your www S3 bucket.
