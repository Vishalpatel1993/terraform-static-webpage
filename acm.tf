#IMPORTANT - if the first time running this for a domian - the terraform script will not complete until the domain has  been validated. Validation can take some time ( roughly 30 minutes)
#DNS validation requires the domain nameservers to already be pointing to AWS. However, you wonâ€™t know the nameservers you need until after the NS Route 53 record has been created.
